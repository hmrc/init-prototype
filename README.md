This was an SBT library for building Gov.UK Design System prototypes. It also included a collection of SBT build tasks 
for managing the HMRC prototyping environment on Heroku. It was used as part of the HMRC CI/CD environment. 

`init-prototype` was deprecated in 2024 as the functionality was made native in Build and Deploy.
